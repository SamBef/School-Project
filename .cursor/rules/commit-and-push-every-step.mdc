# Commit and Push Every Step

This project requires that **every step of the way** is committed and pushed to the remote repository so team members always see current progress.

## When to Commit and Push

- After completing a discrete task or feature (e.g. add a page, fix a bug, update docs).
- After a logical unit of work that could be described in one commit message.
- At the end of any session or before switching context.

## What the Agent Must Do

1. **After finishing a change or set of related changes**: Run `git add -A`, then `git commit` with a clear, present-tense message describing what was done.
2. **After committing**: Run `git push` (or `git push -u origin <branch>` if pushing a new branch) so the remote is updated.
3. **Do not** leave the working tree with uncommitted changes at the end of a task unless the user explicitly asks to pause mid-work.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense, imperative: "Add export filters" not "Added export filters".
- One logical change per commit when possible.
- Message should let teammates understand what changed without reading the diff.

## Technical Note

- Use PowerShell-compatible commands in this repo (e.g. `;` to chain, not `&&`).
- Default branch: `main`. Remote: `origin` (School-Project).

This rule is exclusive to this project and ensures the repo always reflects the latest progress for the team.
